**Overview**

This project predicts obesity levels (such as Normal Weight, Overweight, Obesity Types I–III, etc.) using various machine learning models — Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree.
It performs full data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model comparison to identify the best-performing classifier.
